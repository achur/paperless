This is the paperless project for the cs198 program at Stanford. 
The goal is to create a web interface to make code commenting 
easy, and to avoid paper submission copies. It's almost 2011!

Local Configuration Info
./setup

If you are going to work with local submissions files for testing, 
make sure you put them in a directory called submission_files

For example, for me it should look like this:
submission_files/cs106a/submissions/jkeeshin/(assn)/(student)/(code)

More Detailed

To avoid changes with git commits, the configuration information
is not tracked by the git repository. However, there are two
files called config_local.php and config_web.php which show the 
contents of the configuration files for the web and your local 
machine. To get it to run locally copy the config_local.php file
into a file called config.php.

cp config_local.php config.php

There are two .htaccess files, one for local and one for web.

cp .htaccess_local .htaccess 

to use the local version of the .htaccess file.

That is what is in setup
