This is the paperless project for the cs198 program at Stanford. 
The goal is to create a web interface to make code commenting 
easy, and to avoid paper submission copies. It's almost 2011!

Configuration Info
To avoid changes with git commits, the configuration information
is not tracked by the git repository. However, there are two
files called config_local.php and config_web.php which show the 
contents of the configuration files for the web and your local 
machine. To get it to run locally copy the config_local.php file
into a file called config.php

cp config_local.php config.php

Then create a file called env.js in the static/js/ directory so it knows where
the different themes are. The commented out line is what runs on the web

root_url = 'http://localhost:8888/paperless/';
// root_url = 'http://stanford.edu/class/cs198/cgi-bin/paperless/'


There are two .htaccess files, one for local and one for web.

cp .htaccess_local .htaccess 

to use the local version of the .htaccess file.
