This is the paperless project for the cs198 program at Stanford. 
The goal is to create a web interface to make code commenting 
easy, and to avoid paper submission copies. It's almost 2011!

Configuration Info
To avoid changes with git commits, the configuration information
is not tracked by the git repository. To get this to run locally,
create a file called config.php in the main paperless director
with the following contents. The commented out lines are what run 
on the web side.

define('BASE_DIR', dirname(__FILE__));
define('USERNAME', 'zhoud');
define('CLASSNAME', 'cs106x');
define('SUBMISSIONS_DIR', 'submissions');
define('ROOT_URL', 'http://localhost:8888/paperless/'); 

//define('SUBMISSIONS_DIR', '/afs/ir/class/cs106x/submissions');
//define('ROOT_URL', 'http://stanford.edu/class/cs198/cgi-bin/paperless/'); 

Then create a file called env.js in the static/js/ directory so it knows where
the different themes are. The commented out line is what runs on the web

root_url = 'http://localhost:8888/paperless/';
// root_url = 'http://stanford.edu/class/cs198/cgi-bin/paperless/'
